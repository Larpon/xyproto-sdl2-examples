# C# + SDL2 example

This has only been tested on Arch Linux, using Mono and SDL2.

Pull requests for also supporting other platforms are welcome.

The code can also be compiled with:

    csc /unsafe main.cs

And run with ie.:

    mono main.exe

SDL2 must be installed, or available as a shared library or dll file.
